    <h1>Little info about HTML, CSS & Javascript in making Websites:</h1>

      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <p>
      Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
      HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
      HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
    </p>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
      This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
      and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
    </p>

      <h2>Javascript</h2>
      <p>
      Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
      The vast majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
